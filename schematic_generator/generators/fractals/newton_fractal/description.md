# Newton Fractal

The Newton Fractal is a boundary set in the complex plane which is characterized by Newton's method for iteratively finding the roots of a complex polynomial. The fractal is created by applying Newton's method to every point in the complex plane and then coloring each point based on the root it converges to and the number of iterations it takes to get close to that root.

## Generation

To generate a Newton Fractal, follow these steps:

1. Choose a complex polynomial and its derivative.
2. For each point \(z\) in the complex plane, apply Newton's method to find the nearest root of the polynomial.
   - Newton's formula: \( z_{new} = z - \frac{f(z)}{f'(z)} \)
3. Color each point based on the root it converges to and the number of iterations required to reach a convergence criterion.

## Applications

Newton Fractals are not just aesthetically pleasing, but also help in understanding the dynamics of Newton's method and the structure of complex polynomial equations.

## Example

Consider a polynomial \(f(z) = z^3 - 1\). The Newton Fractal for this polynomial exhibits a three-fold symmetry corresponding to its three roots.

## Interesting polynomial choices

- \(f(z) = z^3 - 1\)
- \(f(z) = z^4 - 1\)
- \(f(z) = z^5 - 1\)
- \(f(z) = z^6 - 1\)

## Visualization

To visualize Newton Fractals, various software tools and programming languages can be used. In this context, software like Fractal Explorer or programming environments like Python with libraries such as Matplotlib can be employed.
